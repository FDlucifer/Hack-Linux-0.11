## Objectives

**Tracking address translation and record it briefly:**

`test.c` is a program that has an infinite loop:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int i = 0x12345678;

int main(void)
{
    printf("The logical/virtual address of i is 0x%08x\n", &i);
    fflush(stdout);
    while (i);
    return 0;
}

```

First, compile `test.c` under Linux 0.11 and start bochs in debug mode. Then, stop the control flow at the while loop, using the debugger tools to observe the segment registers, control registers, and analyze the address translation process of variable i. Finally, break the while loop by directly setting the physical memory of i to zero.

<br />

**Implement a simplified version of the `shmget` and `shmat` system calls in `mm/shm.c` for memory page sharing:**

```c
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size);
```

`shmget` returns the identifier of the shared memory page associated with the value of the argument key.  It may be used either to obtain the identifier of a previously created shared memory segment, or to create a new shared page (with size equal to the value of size rounded up to `PAGE_SIZE`).

On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and `errno` is set to indicate the error.

```c
void *shmat(int shmid);
```

`shmat` attaches the shared memory page identified by `shmid` to the address space of the calling process.

On success `shmat` returns the address of the attached shared memory segment; on error *(void \*) -1* is returned, and `errno` is set to indicate the cause of the error. 

**Notice:**

When process exits, the kernel will release the physical memory pages it occupies. Pay attention to whether other processes are using one of these pages as a shared page.

<br />

**Modify the producer-consumer program `pc.c` we wrote in *5. Implement semaphores*:**

1. Instead of using a file as buffer, use the shared memory via `shmget` and `shmat`ï¼›

2. Split pc.c into two single-process programs `producer.c` and `consumer.c`;

<br />

**Run `producer.c` and `consumer.c` to verify your implementation of shared memory.**
